# Installation Guide

Step-by-step setup for the Claude-BugHunter skill bundle.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** — install from https://claude.ai/download
- **Burp Suite** Professional or Community — https://portswigger.net/burp
- **macOS or Linux** — most steps are macOS-flavored; Linux users adjust paths
- **Java** (for Burp MCP) — usually included with Burp Suite Pro
- **Python 3.10+** (only if you want to regenerate skills via `public-skills-builder`)

## Step 1 — Clone this repo

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Research
cd ~/Research
git clone https://github.com/elementalsouls/Claude-BugHunter.git
cd Claude-BugHunter
```

## Step 2 — Run the installer

```bash
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

This copies:
- All 54 skills → `~/.claude/skills/`
- All 15 slash commands → `~/.claude/commands/`
- The `hunt` shell command → `~/.claude/scripts/hunt.sh` (sourced from your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` automatically)

Existing skills with the same name are backed up (e.g. `bugcrowd-reporting.backup-20260505-153000`) so re-runs are non-destructive.

## Step 3 — Set up Burp MCP

In Burp Suite:
1. Go to **Extensions** → **BApp Store** → search for "MCP Server" → Install
2. Confirm the **Output** tab shows: `Started MCP server on 127.0.0.1:9876`
3. Note the path it extracted the proxy JAR to (typically `~/.BurpSuite/mcp-proxy/mcp-proxy-all.jar`)

In your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add burp -s user -- java -jar ~/.BurpSuite/mcp-proxy/mcp-proxy-all.jar
```

Verify in a fresh `claude` session:

```
/mcp
```

You should see `burp · ✓ connected`.

## Step 4 — (Optional) Refresh vendored skills from upstream

The bundle ships a frozen snapshot of shuvonsec's skills. To pull the latest from upstream and re-bundle:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/install-community-skills.sh
./scripts/install-community-skills.sh
```

This clones `shuvonsec/claude-bug-bounty` into `~/Research/community-skills/` and runs its installer. Useful when you want fresher hunt patterns; not needed for first-time setup.

## Step 5 — (Optional) Set up the skill regenerator

If you want to regenerate `hunt-*` per-class skills from fresh disclosed HackerOne reports periodically:

```bash
cd ~/Research
git clone https://github.com/shuvonsec/public-skills-builder.git
cd public-skills-builder

# Need Python 3.10+ — use Homebrew on macOS
brew install python@3.12
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 2>/dev/null || pip install anthropic httpx pydantic requests

# Configure API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env:
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
#   H1_API_KEY=your_h1_username:your_h1_token
```

> **Important**: Anthropic API and Claude Max are separate billing systems. Max gives you Claude Code access; the API is pay-per-token. You need both keys (`console.anthropic.com/billing` for the API key) to run the generator.

Run the generator:

```bash
python3 public_skills_builder.py --source h1-public --program shopify --limit 200
```

Other H1 programs with high disclosed-report counts: `gitlab`, `hackerone`, `mail-ru`, `valve`, `uber`, `twitter`. The generator outputs flat `.md` files in `skills/` — you'll need to wrap each in its own folder structure (`hunt-name/SKILL.md`) before installing to `~/.claude/skills/`.

### Known issues with public-skills-builder

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `unsupported operand type: str \| None` | Python <3.10 — install 3.12 via Homebrew |
| `Filter parameters must contain at least one program handle` | Add `--program <handle>` |
| `Could not fetch ngalongc/bug-bounty-reference` | Hardcoded `master` branch URLs — patch script to try `main` first |

## Step 6 — Smoke-test

Open a fresh `claude` session in any folder:

```bash
claude
```

Try a hunt-class trigger test:

```
I have a reflected user input that's rendered into the page HTML — testing for XSS. What payloads should I try?
```

Expected: Claude triggers `hunt-xss` and walks you through detection patterns + payloads.

Try the validation flow:

```
/triage
```

Then describe a hypothetical finding. Expected: Claude runs the 7-Question Gate.

Try the engagement scaffold:

```bash
hunt acme-test
ls ~/Targets/acme-test/
```

Expected: a complete folder with `CLAUDE.md`, `scope.md`, `findings/`, `evidence/`, `submissions.txt`, `notes.md`, `.gitignore`.

If all three smoke tests pass, you're set up.

## Step 7 — Cleanup

Delete the test target:

```bash
rm -rf ~/Targets/acme-test
```

Then go find a real program and put it to work. See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for the full workflow walkthrough.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `/mcp` doesn't show burp | Burp Suite not running, or extension not loaded | Re-open Burp, confirm Extensions tab shows MCP Server with "Loaded" checked |
| `hunt: command not found` | Shell didn't pick up the `source` line | Restart your terminal, or `source ~/.zshrc` |
| Skills don't trigger as expected | Description-field keyword mismatch | Mention the bug class explicitly in your prompt (e.g., "I'm testing IDOR on this endpoint") |
| `burp - get_proxy_history_regex` returns empty | Burp's proxy history is empty for that target | Browse the target through Burp first to populate history |
| Python build errors during step 5 | Using system Python 3.9 | Use Homebrew Python 3.12 explicitly: `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 -m venv .venv` |

## Uninstall

To remove everything this repo installed:

```bash
# Remove all bundled skills (this removes EVERY skill in ~/.claude/skills,
# including any you added manually — be selective if needed)
# rm -rf ~/.claude/skills

# Or remove only the originals contributed by this repo:
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/bugcrowd-reporting
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/evidence-hygiene

# Remove all bundled commands
# rm -rf ~/.claude/commands

# Remove the hunt shell command
rm -f ~/.claude/scripts/hunt.sh
sed -i.bak '/claude\/scripts\/hunt.sh/d' ~/.zshrc

# Remove Burp MCP entry
claude mcp remove burp
```
