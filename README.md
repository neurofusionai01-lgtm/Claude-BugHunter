# claude-bughunter

> A self-contained Claude skill bundle for bug hunting and external red-team work · **51 skills** · 15 slash commands · **574+ disclosed-report patterns** across 24 vulnerability classes · enterprise identity + infrastructure attack matrices · engagement-folder scaffolding · Burp MCP integration · battle-tested through Bugcrowd financial-target work AND a paid external red-team engagement against an Indian conglomerate (May 2026).

Built by **[ElementalSoul](https://github.com/elementalsouls)** — Bug Bounty & GenAI Security Research.

## What is this?

`claude-bughunter` is a drop-in skill bundle for the [Claude Code skills system](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills). Install once and Claude Code stops being a chatbot and starts behaving like a senior bug-bounty researcher or red-team operator: it knows the techniques, the chain templates, the VRT mappings, the platform CVE chains, and the hygiene — and it stays in scope.

Four layers stack:

- **`bug-bounty` + `bb-methodology` + `redteam-mindset`** — *how to think.* 5-phase non-linear hunting workflow, critical-thinking framework, developer-psychology heuristics, anomaly detection patterns, and the red-team operator-discipline corrections (when scope is "external red team" not "bug bounty / WAPT").
- **24 `hunt-*` skills + `security-arsenal`** — *what to look for in webapps.* Per-class detection patterns, payloads, bypass tables, and chain templates curated from 574+ disclosed HackerOne reports.
- **Enterprise platform attack chains** — *what to look for on the perimeter.* `m365-entra-attack`, `okta-attack`, `cloud-iam-deep`, `vmware-vcenter-attack`, `enterprise-vpn-attack`, `hunt-sharepoint`, `hunt-aspnet`, `hunt-ntlm-info`, `apk-redteam-pipeline`, `supply-chain-attack-recon` — current 2024-2026 CVE chains, AADSTS error references, version-fingerprint matrices, and post-credential escalation paths.
- **`triage-validation` + `bugcrowd-reporting` + `evidence-hygiene` + `redteam-report-template` + `mid-engagement-ir-detection`** — *how to ship it.* 7-Question Gate, VRT category fallback, severity-request paragraphs, OOS rebuttals, cookie/PII redaction, client-facing red-team deliverable format, and SOC-patch / mid-engagement-attacker detection methodology.

All triggered automatically by topic — describe what you're testing in plain English and the relevant skill loads. No invocation by name.

> **51 skills · 15 commands · 574+ disclosed reports curated · 6-phase workflow · validated through both a Bugcrowd financial-target engagement and a paid external red-team engagement (Shree Cement, May 2026).**

---

## Two interfaces — pick what fits your engagement

The bundle exposes the same content through two interfaces. **Slash commands are the primary interface**; the `cbh` CLI is a secondary terminal-native runner. Both consume the same `skills/` content; they differ in execution model.

| | Slash commands (PRIMARY) | `cbh` CLI (SECONDARY) |
|---|---|---|
| Runs in | A Claude Code conversation | Any terminal with Python 3.9+ |
| Execution | LLM-driven — reads full SKILL.md, applies judgment, can chain skills, can converse | Deterministic — Python stdlib, regex match, real `subfinder`/`dig`/`curl` calls |
| Output | Conversational, contextual, varies per run | Files + structured stdout, identical across runs |
| Best for | Hunting, chain construction, applying discipline rules with nuance, talking through findings | CI/CD, scripted automation, bulk recon, deterministic verification, non-Claude environments |
| Examples | `/recon target.com` `/hunt target.com` `/triage` `/report` `/validate` `/chain` `/autopilot` `/scope` | `cbh recon target.com` (real network I/O) · `cbh triage finding.md` (deterministic 7Q grep) · `cbh report finding.md --platform bugcrowd` |

**Choose by use case:**

- **Exploring a new target?** Use Claude Code with slash commands. The LLM applies judgment that the deterministic CLI can't.
- **Running scheduled recon? Verifying labs? CI gate?** Use `cbh`. It's reproducible and scriptable.
- **You don't have Claude Code installed but want to read the skills/Pattern Libraries?** Use `cbh` plus `cat skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. The content stands on its own.

See [`docs/cbh-cli.md`](docs/cbh-cli.md) for the CLI reference. See the slash command list under **Slash Commands** later in this file for the conversational interface.

## Architecture

51 skills across 6 phases, with a 24-skill `hunt-*` sub-stack, a 7-skill enterprise-platform attack layer (M365/Okta/cloud-IAM/vCenter/VPN/SharePoint/APK), an integration layer (Burp MCP, the `hunt` shell command, optional Anthropic + HackerOne APIs), and a usage decision tree for picking the right skill per task.

![architecture overview](assets/architecture-overview.svg)

For deeper reference views — a 3-layer stack architecture and an engagement pipeline with the 4 branched outcomes from the Validate gate — see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

---

## The 7-Question Gate

Before drafting any report — `/triage` or `/validate` runs every candidate finding through:

1. Can an attacker use this RIGHT NOW with a real HTTP request?
2. Is the impact on the program's accepted-impact list?
3. Is the asset in scope?
4. Does it work without privileged access an attacker can't get?
5. Is this not already known or documented behavior?
6. Can impact be proved beyond "technically possible"?
7. Is this not on the never-submit list?

One NO = KILL. Move on. This single discipline separates productive researchers from N/A noise.

---

## Quick Start

### One-step install (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elementalsouls/Claude-BugHunter.git
cd Claude-BugHunter
./scripts/install.sh
```

That copies all 51 skills to `~/.claude/skills/`, all 15 commands to `~/.claude/commands/`, and sources `hunt.sh` from your shell rc.

### First engagement

```bash
hunt acme-bb              # scaffolds ~/Targets/acme-bb/ with CLAUDE.md, scope.md, findings/, evidence/, submissions.txt
cd ~/Targets/acme-bb
claude                    # opens Claude Code with engagement context
```

In Claude, describe what you're testing in plain English — *"I see a `?url=` parameter, looks SSRF-prone"* — and `hunt-ssrf` auto-loads with detection patterns, payloads, and the 11-bypass IP table.

### Drop-in usage (Claude.ai, Claude API, other harnesses)

```bash
# Copy a single SKILL.md into a Project's system prompt:
cat skills/hunt-rce/SKILL.md | pbcopy
# Paste into Claude.ai project instructions or API system prompt.
```

All skills are plain Markdown — also usable as personal cheat sheets without Claude.

For Burp Suite Pro MCP integration and the optional skill-regenerator setup, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). For the full workflow walkthrough with a worked example, see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

---

## Authorization

These skills are intended for assets you **own** or have **written authorization to assess** (bug-bounty in-scope assets, pentest engagement letters, CTF challenges, your own infrastructure).

The skills include validation gates that auto-trigger when you point Claude at unverified third-party targets — `triage-validation`'s 7-Question Gate explicitly asks whether the asset is in scope (Q3) and on the program's accepted-impact list (Q2). The `bugcrowd-reporting` skill includes researcher-side hygiene (Bugcrowdninja alias, account-state restoration, friendly-tester posture) that signals legitimate authorized testing to the target's fraud team.

The bundle explicitly **excludes**: weaponizing 0-days against unauthorized targets, post-exploitation tooling, malware development, mass-targeting infrastructure. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the full posture.

## Why this exists

Most bug-hunting Claude setups are either too generic (one big "security" prompt) or too fragmented (you bookmark 30 disclosed reports and re-read them every engagement). Neither scales past the second target.

This bundle was built and validated through two paid engagements that exposed different capability gaps:

**Bugcrowd financial target** — surfaced four gaps a starter 3-skill stack could not close:

1. **No hypothesis discipline** — drafts written before validation → wasted hours, hurt validity ratio
2. **No per-program reporting tactics** — VRT defaults auto-downgraded P3-worthy findings to P4
3. **No engagement coordination** — findings, evidence, and submission IDs scattered across folders
4. **No evidence hygiene** — screenshots leaked cookies and victim PII

**External red-team — Indian conglomerate (Shree Cement, May 2026)** — exposed five additional gaps that bug-bounty defaults made worse:

1. **Conservative defaults retracted real findings** — WAPT mindset stopped tests early on defended targets where red-team continuation would have surfaced bypass chains → `redteam-mindset`
2. **No mid-engagement situational awareness** — client SOC patched confirmed SQLi within 30 min; external attacker locked 14 accounts during a live test session — both invisible without explicit detection methodology → `mid-engagement-ir-detection`
3. **No enterprise-platform attack chains** — M365 + Entra ID, on-prem SharePoint, Cisco SSL VPN, vCenter, and 7 Android APKs all needed current 2024-2026 CVE knowledge and platform-specific tradecraft → `m365-entra-attack`, `okta-attack`, `hunt-sharepoint`, `hunt-aspnet`, `hunt-ntlm-info`, `vmware-vcenter-attack`, `enterprise-vpn-attack`, `apk-redteam-pipeline`
4. **No client-facing deliverable format** — bug-bounty report templates don't fit enterprise red-team where output is a 50KB+ MD + DOCX with embedded screenshots → `redteam-report-template`
5. **No post-credential escalation model** — when recon yielded credentials (AWS keys, JWTs, GCP JSON), it was unclear what they granted or how to escalate → `cloud-iam-deep`

The 24 per-class `hunt-*` skills address gap-zero (*"what should I look for in webapps"*) by codifying patterns from 574+ disclosed HackerOne reports — Claude knows the actual chain templates real triagers paid for, not abstract OWASP Top 10. The enterprise-platform and red-team-tradecraft layers address what bug-bounty alone cannot: external red-team engagements against monitored enterprise targets.

---
