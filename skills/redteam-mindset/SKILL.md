name: redteam-mindset
description: Red-team operator discipline — the mindset corrections that separate offensive testing from defensive WAPT. Built from a paid external red-team engagement (Shree Cement, May 2026) where conservative defaults caused multiple findings to be missed and one to be incorrectly retracted. Use at the START of any red-team engagement and again whenever feeling stuck or considering "stopping" on a defended target. The single most important skill to load when scope is "external red team" not "bug bounty / WAPT".

## When to use this skill

Trigger when:
- Engagement scope says "red team", "adversary emulation", "assume breach", "TIBER-style"
- You're tempted to retract a finding because reproducibility failed once
- You're tempted to call a defense "working as intended" instead of probing further
- You hit a blocker (captcha, rate limit, WAF, CA-block, lockout) and consider stopping
- You're about to spend time on IDOR/CSRF/XSS instead of access-yielding bugs
- You found a vuln on app A and there are sister apps B, C, D you haven't touched

DO NOT use for:
- Bug bounty programs (use bug-bounty skill — different scope rules)
- WAPT/PCI-style assessments (use OWASP-aligned skills)
- Pure compliance audits

---

## The one-line summary

**Red team scope = "gain access, prove impact". Bug bounty / WAPT scope = "find a bug, write a report".**

These produce DIFFERENT decisions at every blocker. Internalize the difference before starting.

---

## Mindset correction #1 — The blocker is data, not the stop sign

**Anti-pattern (what I did wrong):**
> "Recheck under load showed no timing differential — recanting the SQLi as indeterminate."

**The correct frame:**
> "The original 3-sample baseline (σ = 32 ms) with three distinct SLEEP payloads each adding +6 s is statistically definitive. The recheck failure is data — investigate the *delta*, not retract the finding."

When a defense suddenly appears mid-engagement:
1. **Original PoC artifacts are forever** — capture them BEFORE recheck. Screenshots, request/response pairs, timing samples.
2. **Diff the response** — body size, headers, cookies, response time. The change tells you what the client deployed (WAF rule? Hotfix? Geo block?).
3. **The deployed mitigation is itself a finding** — positive operational observation about IR responsiveness.
4. **Try alternative vectors** — slower-paced timing, encoded keywords, different injection contexts, cookie injection, header injection.
5. **Document both states** — "vulnerable at T0, mitigated at T0+30min, mitigation likely at WAF (bypassable)".

**Rule:** never retract a finding on first reproducibility failure. Investigate why before declaring false positive.

---

## Mindset correction #2 — Sister-app pattern recognition

**Anti-pattern:**
> "I confirmed SQLi on /medical/wmc/. Moving on to other tasks."

**The correct frame:**
> "Same backend, same code template likely → /custdocument/, /tenderSys/, /etax/, /vMS/, /transporterbidding/ are all probable. Test them with the SAME payload."

When you confirm a vuln on app A:
1. **Identify shared infrastructure** — same IP, same load balancer, same TLS cert, same response headers, same session cookie name, same login form HTML.
2. **Identify shared code template** — same form fields, same error messages, same view structure, same framework version.
3. **Sweep all sisters with the SAME exploit payload immediately.**
4. **Document the class of vulnerability** — "vulnerability is in shared form-handler template across N apps", not just one finding.
5. **Recommend class-fix** — fix the shared template, not just one app.

The Shree Cement engagement: WMC SQLi confirmed; custdocument, transporterbidding, etax, vMS sit on the same eapps host with similar form patterns — likely all share the same vulnerable template. Should have been a multi-app finding.

## Mindset correction #3 — WAPT vs Red Team scope discipline

**Skip these in red team scope (they don't yield access):**
- IDOR (cross-user read/write — WAPT class)
- CSRF (state-change-via-tricked-user — WAPT class)
- Reflected XSS (without account-takeover chain — WAPT class)
- Missing security headers (WAPT class)
- Cookie hardening flags (WAPT class)
- Verbose error messages without sensitive data (WAPT class)
- DoS (out of scope per engagement rules typically)
- Username enumeration (intel-gathering, not access)

**Pursue these (they DO yield access):**
- SQL injection (data exfil → DB creds → lateral)
- Command injection / RCE (foothold)
- File upload → webshell (foothold)
- LFI/RFI (config reads → DB creds → access)
- SSRF (cloud metadata → IAM → cloud access)
- Authentication bypass (parameter manipulation, JWT alg=none, header injection)
- Hardcoded credentials in mobile/JS bundles
- Default credentials on admin panels
- SAML XSW / signature stripping (session hijack)
- Cisco ASA / Citrix / Pulse / Fortinet SSL VPN CVEs (network foothold)
- ManageEngine / Confluence / Atlassian RCE CVEs (foothold)
- Kerberoasting / AS-REP roasting (post-foothold, but enumerate from outside if possible)

**Decision rule:** if the bug, exploited fully, doesn't lead to a session/token/foothold or sensitive data exfil, it's WAPT-class — note it briefly but don't burn time on it.

---

## Mindset correction #4 — Aggressive default, not conservative default

**Anti-pattern:**
> "Tested 30% of the websites and called it comprehensive."

**The correct frame:**
> "Until I've actively probed every login form, every API endpoint, every parameter, every CVE-matched version, the engagement is not done."

Aggressive defaults:
1. **Probe every live host** for top 20 paths (admin, api, login, /.git, /.env, server-status, swagger, openapi.json, robots.txt, /actuator, /healthz, etc.)
2. **For every login form discovered**, attempt 1-of-leaked + 1-of-spray-pattern + SQLi + auth-bypass-via-parameter-tampering
3. **For every JS bundle**, grep for hardcoded API keys, JWT, base URLs, hidden endpoints, admin paths
4. **For every API endpoint**, check OPTIONS preflight, missing-auth response, alg=none JWT, X-Forwarded-User header injection
5. **For every mobile app**, decompile + grep for secrets + check pinned certs + identify exported components
6. **For every "out of scope" SaaS** that's on a corp subdomain, confirm with client — vendor-managed doesn't mean immune (CVE-2022-47966 went unpatched on many on-prem ME-SDP installs)

**Rule:** if you've tested fewer than 60% of the live attack surface, you haven't done red team yet — you've done recon.

---

## Mindset correction #5 — Persistence beats elegance

**Anti-pattern:**
> "Tesseract failed on 3 captchas, gave up, declared captcha bypass not feasible."

**The correct frame:**
> "Tesseract failed. Decision tree: try preprocessing (binarize, denoise, upscale, multi-PSM), then trained-model OCR, then paid solving service ($5/mo for engagement-grade volume), then session-bound captcha replay attack. A real attacker WILL invest the $5."

Decision-tree for blockers:

**Captcha:**
1. Omit field → check if required
2. Empty value → check validation
3. Reuse value across multiple submits → check session-bind
4. Tesseract with preprocessing
5. Trained-model OCR (deep-text-recognition-benchmark, calamari-OCR)
6. Paid solving service (2captcha API, anti-captcha)
7. Audio captcha if available (much weaker)

**WAF:**
1. Slower pace
2. Encode the payload (URL, hex, base64, mixed case)
3. Different injection context (cookie, header, JSON)
4. Different HTTP verb
5. Different content-type (multipart, application/json)
6. Bypass at the host level (X-Forwarded-Host, X-Original-URL)
7. Probe origin server directly (find via certificate transparency)

**Rate limit:**
1. IP rotation (multiple cloud regions)
2. User-Agent rotation
3. Slower pace + jitter
4. Distribute across multiple TLS sessions

**Slow target (timing-based exfil too slow):**
1. Different injection point (avoid per-row SLEEP context)
2. BENCHMARK or GET_LOCK as alternate timing oracle
3. Error-based extraction
4. OOB DNS callback (interactsh)
5. Faster network (cloud VM in same region as target)
6. Run dumper unattended overnight; deliver partial results

**Rule:** when one path fails, the next move is "another vector to the same goal", not "documented as not vulnerable". A real adversary doesn't have an engagement window.

---

## Mindset correction #6 — Real-time IR observation is a finding

When the client SOC patches mid-engagement (you observe a vulnerability disappear during your test):
- **Treat it as evidence**, not as a failure
- **Capture timestamps** before and after the change
- **Document as positive operational finding** — "client SOC detected and mitigated within X minutes; mitigation deployed at WAF/code level"
- **Verify the mitigation depth** — WAF rule (bypassable) vs code fix (real)
- **The original PoC remains the vulnerability finding** — patching doesn't erase it

This is its own skill: see `mid-engagement-ir-detection`.

---

## Mindset correction #7 — Multi-technique cross-validation

For every "vulnerable" finding, prove via 2+ techniques:

| Vuln class | Primary | Cross-check |
|---|---|---|
| Time-based blind SQLi | SLEEP() differential | Different SLEEP variants (3 distinct payloads min) |
| Boolean blind SQLi | Body-size differential | Different boolean comparisons |
| Error-based SQLi | Error message reflection | UPDATEXML + EXTRACTVALUE both |
| RCE | Command output reflection | OOB callback (interactsh DNS) |
| LFI | File content reflection | Different file paths, different encodings |
| SSRF | Internal-only response | OOB callback (interactsh DNS) |
| Valid credential (M365) | ROPC + AADSTS53003 | SAML SSO browser flow + ConvergedConditionalAccess page |
| Auth bypass | Logged-in landing page | Session cookie persistence on subsequent request |

A single signal can be coincidence (network jitter, server hiccup, cache). Two distinct signals from the same root cause is definitive.

---

## Mindset correction #8 — Engagement journal discipline

Real-time, append-only, structured:

```jsonl
{"ts":"2026-05-08T14:40:53","ip":"49.36.184.19","tool":"m365_validator","target":"login.microsoftonline.com","payload":"chetan.sharma:Shree***","resp_code":400,"resp_body_size":154,"resp_ms":1280,"aadsts":"AADSTS53003","verdict":"VALID_CA_BLOCK","notes":""}
```

Why:
- Forensic record of what was tested and when
- Surfaces patterns (clustering, timing changes, error code distribution)
- Becomes evidence for the report
- Survives into next engagement as priors
- Differential analysis: "What changed between window A and window B?"

**Anti-pattern:** ad-hoc shell commands with no logging. You will lose the original PoC timestamp when you need it most (recheck failed, can't prove the original signal was real).

---

## Mindset correction #9 — Time is the constraint, not skill

A real adversary has months. You have an engagement window (weeks). Decisions:
- **Don't pre-judge feasibility** — if a dumper would take 6 hours, run it overnight; deliver partial results in the morning.
- **Parallelize.** Run multi-target tests concurrently. Burn CPU, not wall-clock.
- **State persistence.** Engagements span multiple sessions. State files (`engagement_log/`) make Wednesday's work usable on Friday.
- **Background long-running jobs** — kick them off, set monitors for events, do other work in parallel.
- **Don't repeat yourself** — if you tested target X with payload Y on Tuesday, Wednesday you should know that without re-testing.

## Pre-engagement checklist

Before starting a red team engagement, confirm:

- [ ] Scope clear (subdomains in/out, SaaS in/out, phishing in/out, implant in/out)
- [ ] SOW + EL/RoE referenced
- [ ] Test IPs allocated and logged (IP_LOGS table or equivalent)
- [ ] State file initialized (`engagement_log/` with attempt counter, results JSONL, IP log)
- [ ] Hard-cap for cred attacks decided (1 or 2 per user lifetime)
- [ ] Kill-switch thresholds set (max LOCKED in run, max errors in window)
- [ ] Crown-jewel target identified (what does winning look like?)
- [ ] Critical-finding-discuss protocol agreed (when to pause and notify)
- [ ] Burp proxy as default for evidence capture
- [ ] Engagement journal initialized

---

## During-engagement checklist

Every 30 minutes ask:

- [ ] Am I making progress, or stuck?
- [ ] Have I logged the last test result to the engagement journal?
- [ ] Is the IP I'm testing from logged?
- [ ] If I confirmed a vuln: have I tested sister apps with same backend?
- [ ] If I hit a blocker: did I try the next vector in the decision tree?
- [ ] If I'm tempted to "stop" — am I sure scope is exhausted, or am I just tired?

---

## Post-engagement checklist

Before declaring done:

- [ ] All findings have at least 2 cross-technique confirmations
- [ ] Each finding's PoC is reproducible in <5 minutes by another tester
- [ ] Original PoC artifacts (screenshots, request/response, timing samples) preserved
- [ ] Mid-engagement IR observations documented as findings (positive ops)
- [ ] Active-attacker observations documented (lockout differentials, etc.)
- [ ] Sister-app sweep complete for every shared-infra finding
- [ ] State files preserved for future engagement
- [ ] Tooling gaps logged (what would have changed outcomes)

---

## Anti-patterns to flag immediately

If you catch yourself thinking any of these, STOP and reconsider:

- "It's not vulnerable" (have I tested 3 vectors? have I tested sister apps?)
- "The defense is working" (have I tried alternative payloads? slower pace? different protocol?)
- "Recheck failed so it must have been a false positive" (NO — investigate the delta)
- "OCR isn't reliable, can't bypass captcha" (paid service is $5; we're not on a personal-research budget)
- "Mobile app is years old, probably nothing useful" (hardcoded URLs and tokens often outlive the engineering team's memory)
- "SaaS, so nothing to test" (vendor patches centrally — usually true, but tenant config gaps are NOT central)
- "We've tested enough" (use the during-engagement checklist; if any answer is "no", keep going)
- "The exfil would take too long" (run it unattended; deliver partials)

---

## When to stop (the legitimate stop conditions)

Only stop when:
- All in-scope assets have been actively probed (not just discovered) for top vuln classes
- Every confirmed vuln has been validated via 2+ techniques
- Every confirmed vuln has been swept on its sister apps
- Every blocker has been attempted via 2+ alternative vectors
- Engagement window has expired AND deliverables are documented
- Client has explicitly directed you to stop

NOT legitimate stop conditions:
- "I'm tired of this target"
- "The first attempt didn't work"
- "Defenses are working"
- "I documented it"
- "We've already informed the client"

---

## Bridge to neighboring skills

After internalizing this mindset, layer the technique-specific skills:
- `m365-entra-attack` — M365 credential attack chain
- `mid-engagement-ir-detection` — turning client SOC patches into findings
- `hunt-sqli` — SQL injection across techniques
- `hunt-rce` — RCE across vectors
- `bug-bounty` — for distinguishing red-team vs bb scope when working dual-track

This skill is the operational discipline; those are the techniques.
